                    During my industrial training period, I gained valuable insights and knowledge about the Palace of Justice and the life cycle of records management. The Palace of Justice, as a government body, maintains a high level of confidentiality, making access strictly regulated. 
                    Only individuals with valid reasons are allowed entry, and access cards are issued to those who need to enter the offices. Through this experience, I learned not only about the administrative structure but also about the importance of records management and the meticulous processes involved in maintaining confidentiality. </p>

                    One of the most challenging experiences in my life happened during the COVID-19 pandemic. As a high school student at the time, the situation worsened happened when my friends tested positive for COVID-19 while in boarding school a day before big examination of SPM. 
                    This unfortunate event led to all my batchmate being quarantined cause of close-contact with that one friends, tested positive for COVID-19. It was disheartening not to experience the nerves and excitement of the first day of such an important exam.
                    After the quarantine period ended, we were required to undergo multiple swab tests to ensure we were no longer positive for COVID-19. This entire experience was emotionally draining and one of the most challenging periods of my life.
