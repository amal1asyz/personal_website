                    Life in primary school at Sekolah Kebangsaan Sri Serdang (SKSS) felt joyful and fulfilling, filled with the excitement of new friendships, discovery, and learning. 
                    I actively participated in a wide range of activities and sports, creating unforgettable memories. I took part in storytelling competitions, where I proudly secured 1st and 2nd place awards.
                    Additionally, I was involved in various sports, such as netball and handball tournaments, and other school events. I also had the honor of being a school prefect, a role that introduced leadership and responsibility in me.
                    Furthermore, I held a position in the school's co-curricular clubs, such as Persatuan Pandu Puteri Tunas and Netball, contributing to their activities and initiatives.
                    These experiences made my primary school years truly remarkable, filled with achievements and memories that will always hold a special place in my heart.

                    Life during secondary school at Sekolah Agama Menengah Sungai Merab Luar wasn’t easy, but it was incredibly rewarding. The unexpected challenge of the world going into lockdown forced us to adapt to remote learning, which was a completely different experience from face-to-face classes. 
                    It required a lot of discipline, focus, and self-motivation to stay on track for focusing on SPM examination. Despite these challenges, the bond I shared with my friends in boarding school became a source of strength and comfort. 
                    Those five years were not just about academics but also about building lifelong friendships and creating memories that I will cherish forever.
                    Looking back, I truly miss the shared laughter and late-night study sessions. Although we’ve all gone our separate ways to pursue our individual paths,
                     I hope that my friends are doing well, staying safe, and always under Allah's blessings ❤️.</p>

                    Life in university is a completely different chapter for me. Being surrounded by people from diverse backgrounds, each with their own attitudes and perspectives, was a whole new experience for me. 
                    My first semester went smoothly—it felt like a fresh start filled with excitement and curiosity. But as the semesters progressed, I found myself on an emotional roller coaster. There were moments of joy and accomplishment, but also times of stress and self-doubt. 
                    The three years of diploma studies may seem short, but they were packed with meaning. I gained not only knowledge but also valuable life skills. I made new friends who enriched my life, explored different surroundings and learned to navigate the ups and downs of university life. It's all about how you choose to manage these experiences.</p>
